## Background

Limited process around managing the Chef Deployment
Need a compliance / Inspec process

They are paying for Inspec as a separately bundled SKU but we really want to just pull all that together.

## Some meeting with them at some point

I demonstrated how to include a Compliance profile into the cookbook itself. That was well received, we now need to get them to incorporate that into their stack. This helps them in that they don't have to have a separate process to publish the profiles.
