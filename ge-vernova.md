## Problem Statement(s)

- Too many different parts of the organization
- Business units are churning
- Some folks are relying on other business for Chef Server (Jeff for instance)

## GE Corporate Synch / CSM Introduction - 07/27/2022

| Business   | Attendee       | Attendee      |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| GE Capital | Paul Krempa    | Gowri Ganesan |
| Chef       | Joshua Roberts | Mike Butler   |

- This was more of a management / leadership call
- Like to work with Jeff Stasko (Although he was pulled off, we did not mention that to them.)
- Mentioned ChefConf
- Customer Success Slack
- We will create an Office Hours and get it out to the technical folks.
